## Simple RayTracer in C++

The aim is to build from scratch a CPU ray tracer with focus on implicit surfaces.

I'm taking inspiration from:

  * *Ray Tracing from the Ground Up* by Kevin Suffern
  * *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* by Peter Shirley
  * [scratchpixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/advanced-rendering/rendering-distance-fields) tutorials

First I'll put together something ugly but that get's the job done.
Then I'll improve it or move on to graphical APIs (thinking of Vulkan)
