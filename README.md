## Simple RayTracer in C++

The aim is to build from scratch a CPU ray tracer with focus on implicit surfaces.

I'm taking inspiration from:

  * *Ray Tracing from the Ground Up* by Kevin Suffern
  * *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* by Peter Shirley

Then I want to use graphical APIs (thinking of Vulkan)
